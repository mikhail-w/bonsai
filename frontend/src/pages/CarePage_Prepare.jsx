             <strong>Semi-Cascade (Han-Kengai):</strong> A less extreme version

           Essential Bonsai Styling Techniques
         </Heading>

         <Text mb="4">
           Styling a bonsai is about manipulating its growth in a way that
           mimics full-sized trees in nature. Here are the key techniques used
           to style a bonsai tree:

         <Heading as="h3" size="md" mb="2">
           1. Pruning
         </Heading>
         <Text mb="4">
           Pruning controls the overall shape and size of the tree. Maintenance
           pruning trims new growth to maintain the tree’s compact shape, while
           structural pruning removes larger branches to create a specific form.

           2. Wiring
         </Heading>
         <Text mb="4">
           Wiring bends branches into specific positions, creating elegant
           curves. Be sure to remove the wire before it cuts into the bark, once
           the branch has set in its new position.

           3. Thinning
         </Heading>
         <Text mb="4">
           Thinning involves removing overcrowded branches to improve balance
           and ensure light reaches all parts of the tree.

           4. Defoliation
         </Heading>
         <Text mb="4">
           Defoliation removes leaves to encourage smaller foliage and redirect
           energy. Only use this technique on species that can handle it.

           Choosing the Right Pot and Placement

         <Text mb="4">
           The pot’s color, size, and shape should complement the tree’s design.
           Ensure the pot has adequate drainage and room for root growth, and
           choose shapes that enhance the style of your bonsai.
